A computational notebook is a shareable document that combines computer code, plain language descriptions, data, rich visualizations like 3D models, charts, graphs and figures, and interactive controls. A notebook, along with an editor like JupyterLab, provides a fast interactive environment for prototyping and explaining code, exploring and visualizing data, and sharing ideas with others.
